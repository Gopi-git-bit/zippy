  user: null,

  isAuthenticated: false,

  isLoading: false,

  token: null,

  

  login: async (credentials) => {

    set({ isLoading: true });

    try {

      const response = await authAPI.login(credentials);

      set({ 

        user: response.user, 

        token: response.token, 

        isAuthenticated: true,

        isLoading: false 

      });

      await AsyncStorage.setItem('auth_token', response.token);

    } catch (error) {

      set({ isLoading: false });

      throw error;

    }

  },

  

  logout: async () => {

    await AsyncStorage.removeItem('auth_token');

    set({ user: null, token: null, isAuthenticated: false });

  },

  

  refreshToken: async () => {

    // Token refresh logic

  }

}));

// Order Management Store

const useOrderStore = create((set, get) => ({

  orders: [],

  currentOrder: null,

  orderHistory: [],

  isLoading: false,

  

  createOrder: async (orderData) => {

    set({ isLoading: true });

    try {

      const response = await orderAPI.create(orderData);

      set(state => ({ 

        orders: [...state.orders, response.order],

        currentOrder: response.order,

        isLoading: false 

      }));

      return response.order;

    } catch (error) {

      set({ isLoading: false });

      throw error;

    }

  },

  

  updateOrderStatus: (orderId, status) => {

    set(state => ({

      orders: state.orders.map(order => 

        order.id === orderId ? { ...order, status } : order

      ),

      currentOrder: state.currentOrder?.id === orderId 

        ? { ...state.currentOrder, status } 

        : state.currentOrder

    }));

  }

}));

// Location and Tracking Store

const useLocationStore = create((set, get) => ({

  currentLocation: null,

  isTracking: false,

  locationHistory: [],

  

  startTracking: () => {

    set({ isTracking: true });

    // Initialize location tracking

  },

  

  stopTracking: () => {

    set({ isTracking: false });

    // Stop location tracking

  },

  

  updateLocation: (location) => {

    set(state => ({

      currentLocation: location,

      locationHistory: [...state.locationHistory, location]

    }));

  }

}));

The state management architecture implements optimistic updates for better user experience, automatic synchronization with backend services, and comprehensive error handling for network failures and data inconsistencies.

Real-time Communication Integration

Real-time functionality is integrated throughout the mobile applications using Socket.IO client with automatic reconnection and offline queue management. The real-time architecture handles location updates, order status changes, and instant messaging between users.

// Real-time Service Integration

class RealTimeService {

  constructor() {

    this.socket = null;

    this.isConnected = false;

    this.messageQueue = [];

  }

  

  connect(token) {

    this.socket = io(API_BASE_URL, {

      auth: { token },

      transports: ['websocket', 'polling']

    });

    

    this.socket.on('connect', () => {

      this.isConnected = true;

      this.processMessageQueue();

    });

    

    this.socket.on('disconnect', () => {

      this.isConnected = false;

    });

    

    this.socket.on('order_status_updated', (data) => {

      useOrderStore.getState().updateOrderStatus(data.orderId, data.status);

    });

    

    this.socket.on('location_update_request', () => {

      this.sendLocationUpdate();

    });

  }

  

  sendLocationUpdate() {

    const location = useLocationStore.getState().currentLocation;

    if (location && this.isConnected) {

      this.socket.emit('update_location', location);

    } else {

      this.messageQueue.push({ type: 'location_update', data: location });

    }

  }

  

  processMessageQueue() {

    while (this.messageQueue.length > 0) {

      const message = this.messageQueue.shift();

      this.socket.emit(message.type, message.data);

    }

  }

}

Component Architecture and Design System

The mobile applications implement a comprehensive design system with reusable components that ensure consistency across both customer and driver applications. The component architecture emphasizes accessibility, performance, and maintainability.

// Base Component Structure

const BaseButton = ({ 

  variant = 'primary',

Security Architecture and Implementation
Security is implemented as a multi-layered approach covering authentication, authorization, data protection, network security, and compliance requirements. The security architecture addresses both application-level and infrastructure-level threats while maintaining usability and performance.
Authentication and Authorization Framework
The authentication system implements OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens, multi-factor authentication, and comprehensive session management. The authorization framework utilizes role-based access control with fine-grained permissions for different user types and administrative functions.

// Security Middleware Implementation

const authenticationMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {

  try {

    const token = extractTokenFromHeader(req.headers.authorization);

    

    if (!token) {

      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });

    }

    

    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

    const user = await User.findById(decoded.userId);

    

    if (!user || !user.isActive) {

      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid or inactive user' });

    }

    

    // Check token blacklist

    const isBlacklisted = await redis.get(`blacklist:${token}`);

    if (isBlacklisted) {

      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Token has been revoked' });

    }

    

    req.user = user;

    req.token = token;

    next();

  } catch (error) {

    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid authentication token' });

  }

};

// Role-based Authorization

const requireRole = (roles) => {

  return (req, res, next) => {

    if (!req.user) {

      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });

    }

    

    if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {

      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' });

    }

    

    next();

  };

};

// Rate Limiting Implementation

const rateLimiter = rateLimit({

  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes

  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs

  message: 'Too many requests from this IP',

  standardHeaders: true,

  legacyHeaders: false,

  store: new RedisStore({

    client: redisClient,

    prefix: 'rl:'

  })

});
Data Protection and Encryption
Data protection implements encryption at rest and in transit with comprehensive key management and data classification. Sensitive data including payment information, personal details, and location data receives enhanced protection through field-level encryption and access logging.

// Data Encryption Service

class EncryptionService {

  constructor() {

    this.algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm';

    this.keyLength = 32;

    this.ivLength = 16;

    this.tagLength = 16;

  }

  

  encrypt(text, key) {

    const iv = crypto.randomBytes(this.ivLength);

    const cipher = crypto.createCipher(this.algorithm, key, iv);

    

    let encrypted = cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex');

    encrypted += cipher.final('hex');

    

    const tag = cipher.getAuthTag();

    

    return {

      encrypted,

      iv: iv.toString('hex'),

      tag: tag.toString('hex')

    };

  }

  

  decrypt(encryptedData, key) {

    const decipher = crypto.createDecipher(

      this.algorithm, 

      key, 

      Buffer.from(encryptedData.iv, 'hex')

    );

    

    decipher.setAuthTag(Buffer.from(encryptedData.tag, 'hex'));

    

    let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedData.encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');

    decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');

    

    return decrypted;

  }

}

// PII Data Handling

const piiFields = ['email', 'phone', 'address', 'aadhar_number', 'pan_number'];

const sanitizeUserData = (userData, userRole) => {

  const sanitized = { ...userData };

  

  if (userRole !== 'admin' && userRole !== 'owner') {

    piiFields.forEach(field => {

      if (sanitized[field]) {

        sanitized[field] = maskSensitiveData(sanitized[field]);

      }

    });

  }

  

  return sanitized;

};
Network Security and API Protection
Network security implements comprehensive protection including DDoS mitigation, API gateway security, and network segmentation. The security architecture includes Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection, SSL/TLS termination, and comprehensive logging for security monitoring.

// Security Headers Middleware

const securityHeaders = (req, res, next) => {

  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');

  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');

  res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');

  res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');

  res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'");

  res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');

  next();

};

// Input Validation and Sanitization

const validateOrderInput = [

  body('pickup_address').isLength({ min: 10, max: 200 }).trim().escape(),

  body('delivery_address').isLength({ min: 10, max: 200 }).trim().escape(),

   
 body('cargo_weight').isFloat({ min: 0.1, max: 50000 }),

  body('consignee_phone').isMobilePhone('en-IN'),

  body('consignee_email').optional().isEmail().normalizeEmail(),


  (req, res, next) => {

    const errors = validationResult(req);

    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {

      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });

    }

    next();

  }

];
Performance Optimization and Monitoring

      FROM orders o

      LEFT JOIN customer_profiles c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id

      LEFT JOIN driver_profiles d ON o.driver_id = d.driver_id

      LEFT JOIN vehicles v ON o.vehicle_id = v.vehicle_id

      LEFT JOIN vehicle_types vt ON v.vehicle_type_id = vt.vehicle_type_id

      WHERE ($1::text IS NULL OR o.order_status = $1)

      AND ($2::uuid IS NULL OR o.customer_id = $2)

      ORDER BY o.created_at DESC

      LIMIT $3 OFFSET $4

    `;

    

    const result = await db.query(query, [

      filters.status,

      filters.customerId,

      pagination.limit,

      pagination.offset

    ]);

    

    return result.rows;

  }

  

  async getNearbyVehicles(latitude, longitude, radius = 10) {

    const query = `

      SELECT 

        v.*,

        vt.type_name,

        ST_Distance(

          ST_Point(v.current_longitude, v.current_latitude)::geography,

          ST_Point($2, $1)::geography

        ) as distance

      FROM vehicles v

      JOIN vehicle_types vt ON v.vehicle_type_id = vt.vehicle_type_id

      WHERE v.current_status = 'available'

      AND ST_DWithin(

        ST_Point(v.current_longitude, v.current_latitude)::geography,

        ST_Point($2, $1)::geography,

        $3 * 1000

      )

      ORDER BY distance

      LIMIT 20

    `;

    

    const result = await db.query(query, [latitude, longitude, radius]);

    return result.rows;

  }

}

// Caching Strategy Implementation

class CacheService {

  constructor() {

    this.redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

    this.defaultTTL = 300; // 5 minutes

  }

  

  async get(key) {

    try {

      const cached = await this.redis.get(key);

      return cached ? JSON.parse(cached) : null;

    } catch (error) {

      console.error('Cache get error:', error);

      return null;

    }

  }

  

  async set(key, value, ttl = this.defaultTTL) {

    try {

      await this.redis.setex(key, ttl, JSON.stringify(value));

    } catch (error) {

      console.error('Cache set error:', error);

    }

  }

  

  async invalidatePattern(pattern) {

    try {

      const keys = await this.redis.keys(pattern);

      if (keys.length > 0) {

        await this.redis.del(...keys);

      }

    } catch (error) {

      console.error('Cache invalidation error:', error);

    }

  }

}
Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring includes application performance monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, user experience tracking, and business metrics collection. The monitoring strategy provides real-time alerts, performance insights, and operational intelligence.

  name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',

  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in seconds',

  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code']

});

const activeOrders = new prometheus.Gauge({

  name: 'active_orders_total',

  help: 'Total number of active orders'

});

const databaseConnections = new prometheus.Gauge({

  name: 'database_connections_active',

  help: 'Number of active database connections'

});

// Monitoring Middleware

const monitoringMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {

  const start = Date.now();

  

  res.on('finish', () => {

    const duration = (Date.now() - start) / 1000;

    httpRequestDuration

      .labels(req.method, req.route?.path || req.path, res.statusCode)

      .observe(duration);

  });

  

  next();

};

// Health Check Endpoint

app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {

  const health = {

    status: 'healthy',

    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),

    services: {}

  };

  

  try {

    // Database health check

    await db.query('SELECT 1');

    health.services.database = 'healthy';

    health.services.database = 'unhealthy';

    health.status = 'unhealthy';

  }

  

  try {

    // Redis health check

    await redis.ping();

    health.services.redis = 'healthy';

  } catch (error) {

    health.services.redis = 'unhealthy';

    health.status = 'unhealthy';

  }

  

  const statusCode = health.status === 'healthy' ? 200 : 503;

  res.status(statusCode).json(health);
